<h4>5. SpO2 Rate:</h4>
<p>--> When users input their current heart rate (BPM) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) level. The app then analyzes this data to determine if the SpO2 level is within normal parameters, low, or indicative of an emergency situation. This comprehensive assessment helps users promptly identify potential respiratory issues or emergencies.</p>
